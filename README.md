# About me


I am Ujwal Karippali Chandran, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a passion for building efficient, scalable systems.

With over three years of experience as a **Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase**, I specialized in designing and developing microservices using spring boot and user interfaces using react. My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and SQL, as well as frameworks like Spring Boot, React, and TensorFlow. 

I’m also experienced in cloud platforms, holding an AWS certification and proficiency in Google Cloud. My fast-track promotion to Software Engineer II awarded to the **top 4%** globally at Chase reflect my strong technical abilities and dedication to driving results.

I have worked on innovative projects, such as developing algorithms to optimize police patrol routes and building automation systems for hospitals. My project experience is supported by strong accomplishments in hackathons, including being a Smart India Hackathon winner and receiving awards from GE HealthCare and Reverie Technologies.

Currently, I am diving deeper into areas like algorithms, data-center scale computing, and natural language processing. In addition to my academic and professional work

# Projects and Publications

**Police Patrolling Optimization** : Developed an algorithm for optimizing police patrol routes by prioritizing locations
based on crime records, the presence of banks and schools. Integrated data from a machine learning model into a
customized Travelling Salesman Algorithm to determine the most efficient patrol path.

**Student Buddy** : Spearheaded a project to automate the distribution of study materials and college event updates to
students. This system efficiently populates the database with real-time event information by aggregating data from class
social media groups. Tech Stack: Python, Selenium, MySQL, Java Servlets, JSPs

**Detection of Covid-19 through cough and breathing sounds using CNN**:
By employing an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks, cough, breathing, and speech sounds were analyzed to
determine if a person is infected with COVID-19, achieving an accuracy of 88.75%.

**Optimizing Hospital-Patient Interactions through Advanced ML and NLP Link**
Engineered a hospital automation system using Feed forward neural network and a BERT-based NLP summarizer to
streamline appointment booking and optimize resource allocation within the healthcare facility.
