## About me

###
I am Ujwal Karippali Chandran, a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a passion for building efficient, scalable systems.

With over three years of experience as a Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase, I specialized in designing microservices and user interfaces that improved customer experiences. My fast-track promotion to Software Engineer II and recognition as part of the top 4% globally at Chase reflect my strong technical abilities and dedication to driving results.

My technical expertise spans multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and SQL, as well as frameworks like Spring Boot, React, and TensorFlow. I’m also experienced in cloud platforms, holding an AWS certification and proficiency in Google Cloud.

I enjoy working on innovative projects, such as developing algorithms to optimize police patrol routes and building automation systems for hospitals. My project experience is supported by strong accomplishments in hackathons, including being a Smart India Hackathon winner and receiving awards from GE HealthCare and Reverie Technologies.

Currently, I am diving deeper into areas like algorithms, data-center scale computing, and natural language processing. In addition to my academic and professional work
